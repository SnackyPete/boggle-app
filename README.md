# Battlefy Boggle Challenge

Boggle is a word game played using a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters. Your request today is to re-create the boggle game in Javascript.


## Rules

The game begins with sixteen letters that sit on a 4x4 grid. The player has a three-minute timer to come up with as many words as possible.

The board consist of English letters only and “Qu” must be together. For the purpose of this task, distribution of the letters does not matter. The player can not enter a word more than once and the word must exist in the English vocabulary. 

Points will be acculumated based on the following:


| Word length    | Points
|----------------|--------
| 3, 4           | 1
| 5              | 2
| 6              | 3
| 7              | 5
| 8+             | 11


## Features

There are four features we would like to see implemented
* Generate Randomized Boggle Board
* Enter a word that I found
* Points system
* Timer

For each of the features: 
* write up user stories
* estimate how long it will take you to implement
* implement the features
* write tests

At the end, we will do a code review for all the features.
